# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Executive Summary

This Business Requirements Document (BRD) outlines the business needs and objectives for the GG Interview System - a SaaS platform offering AI-powered technical interview practice for software engineers preparing for job interviews.

The system consists of three main components:
1. An AI agent service that simulates an interviewer and evaluates solutions
2. A web application interface for conducting realistic interview practice
3. A problem service that provides a library of interview questions and challenges

## Business Objectives

The primary business objectives of the GG Interview System are to:

1. Generate recurring revenue through tiered subscription plans
2. Provide software engineers with realistic technical interview practice
3. Offer premium content like system design interview simulations as upsell opportunities
4. Scale the user base while maintaining high-quality AI interactions
5. Establish the platform as a leading technical interview preparation tool

## Stakeholders

Key stakeholders include:
- **Individual Users**: Software engineers preparing for technical interviews
- **Enterprise Customers**: Companies purchasing bulk licenses for employees/candidates
- **Platform Administrators**: Technical team maintaining the SaaS platform
- **Product Team**: Responsible for feature development and subscription tiers

## Market Assessment

The technical interview preparation market has several established players, but many solutions lack:
- Realistic AI-powered interview simulations
- High-quality system design interview practice
- Personalized feedback on both technical and communication skills
- Continuously updated problem libraries reflecting current industry questions

The GG Interview System addresses these gaps by providing:
- AI-powered interview simulations with audio/video interaction
- Premium system design interview modules
- Tiered subscription plans for different needs and budgets
- LeetCode-integrated problem library with AI-generated solutions
