# Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: GG Interview System  
**Date**: April 13, 2025  
**Project Manager**: [Project Manager Name]  
**Executive Sponsor**: [Executive Sponsor Name]

## Project Description

The GG Interview System is a SaaS platform offering AI-powered technical interview practice for software engineers preparing for job interviews. The system comprises three core components:

1. **AI Agent Service**: Python-based system running on port 8000 that simulates an interviewer and evaluates solutions
2. **Web Application**: Next.js application running on port 3500 that provides realistic interview practice with audio/video capabilities
3. **Problem Service**: Node.js service running on port 3000 that integrates with LeetCode's GraphQL API to maintain an updated problem library

This innovative solution will be monetized through tiered subscription plans, from a free basic tier to premium offerings including system design interview modules.
